# Fake_News_Detector
In recent years, the rapid dissemination of misinformation and fake
news, particularly on digital platforms and social media, has become a
significant global issue. Fake news poses threats to public trust, societal stability, and democracy, as it can mislead individuals, distort
perceptions, and provoke harmful actions. With the increasing
complexity of fake news, traditional methods of verification are
inadequate, necessitating the development of automated solutions. Current challenges include detecting fake news across multiple
domains, handling diverse formats (text, images, videos), and
ensuring timely identification before misinformation spreads widely. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and scalable automated
system capable of detecting and classifying fake news using deep
learning techniques.
